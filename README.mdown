# Add Virtual Host Tool

## Why?

I whipped up this tool because I find myself constantly adding vhosts manually,
which could easily be automated in my case.

## How?

Simply writes to apache configuration and hosts file using ruby and a shell script
to make things easier on the fingers

To use just add the files to a folder and add them to your $PATH, using like so:

sudo sh add-vhost.sh mydomain.dev

Once done, restart apache.
